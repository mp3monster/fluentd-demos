# fluentd-demos
My demo resources to help illustrate different aspects of FluentD

More about the demo and the context can be found at https://blog.mp3monster.org/2019/09/10/observability-london-oracle-developer-meetup/

# Demo1
This is the ultimate hello World accepting HTTP calls and simply pushing to standard out

# Demo2
A more sophisticated demo, but more plausable set of activities. For example, notifications are filtered, enriched and pushed to Slack and several other channels.  Forwarded to another FluentD server as you would when implementing a concentrator network.
